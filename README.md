# Finance Trends & Alarms

A self-hosted **personal finance dashboard** built from the transaction alert emails your bank already
sends you, with **fraud alarms** built in.

It reads those emails (read-only), stores every transaction in PostgreSQL, and turns them into:

* **An overview** (the home page): what you've spent this month against your usual month, a month-end
  forecast, categories against their budgets, the last 12 months, top merchants, recent transactions,
  and anything that needs a look.
* **Spending trends**: every category and merchant as a trend you can chart by day, week or month, over
  years of history; budgets with near/over-limit warnings; fixed monthly expenses that never reach your
  card (rent, transfers); and actual-vs-expected comparisons for every month.
* **Savings loop**: a monthly savings target (SP) against projected savings (PV), with income and fixed expenses as
  known disturbances and a daily spending allowance as the output; HI/HIHI when you're heading for an overspend.
* **Bank statements**: the totals from your monthly statement PDFs (money out, money in, balances), with each card's
  billing compared against what your alert emails captured.
* **Alarms**: charges that look like fraud (card tests, large or foreign purchases, anything the anomaly
  model finds unusual) are raised as prioritised alarms for you to review, plus an optional daily report
  email with what to quote when you call your bank.

It looks and behaves like a **SCADA operator screen**: the screens follow **ISA-101** (grey and quiet while
everything is normal, colour reserved for abnormal conditions such as alarms and budgets at their HI/HIHI
limits), alarms follow **ISA-18.2** (priorities, acknowledgement, journal), and spending is modelled like a
plant historian (categories are devices, merchants are tags, budgets are setpoints).

> **Passive by design.** It only *observes*: it reads your mailbox read-only (it never marks, moves or
> sends mail), and it never blocks a card, contacts your bank or moves money. Acting on an alarm (calling
> the bank, freezing the card) is always your decision. It is also **not real-time**: it sees a
> transaction once the bank's email arrives and the next inbox sync runs (every 5 minutes by default).

```
 IMAP inbox ──► parse email ──► transaction ──► categories, budgets, trends ──► overview & spending
 (read-only)     (parsers.py)   (PostgreSQL)  └► features ──► anomaly score ──► alarm rules ──► alarms (UI, report, webhook)
```

The project started as *CC Transaction Alarm Dashboard*. The internal names (the `fraudalert` package and
CLI, `FRAUDALERT_*` settings) are unchanged, so existing installs keep working.

## Quick start (Docker)

```bash
cp .env.example .env        # fill in IMAP credentials + sender filter
docker compose up -d        # postgres + web UI (http://localhost:8000) + worker (syncs every 5 min)
```

The compose database is published on host port **5433**, so it doesn't clash with a Postgres you may
already run on 5432. Change `FRAUDALERT_DB_HOST_PORT` / `FRAUDALERT_WEB_HOST_PORT` in `.env` if those
ports are taken too.

## Quick start (local)

```bash
python -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e ".[dev]"
cp .env.example .env                     # point FRAUDALERT_DATABASE_URL at your Postgres
fraudalert init-db                       # creates tables + the default rule
fraudalert sync                          # pull bank emails once
fraudalert serve --sync-interval 300     # web UI on http://127.0.0.1:8000, syncing every 5 min
```

Try it without touching your inbox:

```bash
python examples/generate_samples.py examples/sample_emails
fraudalert import-eml examples/sample_emails
fraudalert serve
```

### Inbox setup

* **Gmail**: turn on 2-step verification, create an [App Password](https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords),
  and use it as `FRAUDALERT_IMAP_PASSWORD`. Host `imap.gmail.com`.
* **Outlook / iCloud / Fastmail**: use their IMAP host and an app-specific password.
* Set `FRAUDALERT_SENDER_FILTER` to your bank's alert address (e.g. `no.reply.alerts@chase.com`).
  You can list several, separated by commas. Optionally set `FRAUDALERT_SUBJECT_FILTER` too.
* The mailbox is opened **read-only** and messages are fetched with `BODY.PEEK`, so nothing is marked as
  read. The first sync looks back `FRAUDALERT_LOOKBACK_DAYS` (90 by default). Later syncs are incremental,
  and emails are de-duplicated by Message-ID.
* Your bank also has to send the alerts: in its app, set the "transaction alert" threshold to $0.01
  so every purchase produces an email.

### Backfilling older emails (years of history)

`FRAUDALERT_LOOKBACK_DAYS` only applies to the very first sync. To pull in older alerts later, for
example for spending trends or a better-trained anomaly model, run a backfill:

```bash
docker compose exec worker fraudalert backfill --since 3y --folder "[Gmail]/All Mail"
# or locally:  fraudalert backfill --since 2022-01-01
```

* `--since` takes a date (`2022-01-01`) or a number of years (`3y`). Gmail keeps mail until you delete it;
  your bank's sending history is the real limit.
* `--folder` searches another IMAP folder for this run only. In Gmail, archived alerts are only in
  *All Mail*. The folder's name follows your Gmail language (e.g. `[Gmail]/Todos` in Spanish).
* Emails you already have are skipped, so it's safe to re-run, or to run with a later date first and
  then go further back. The regular sync's position is left alone.
* Nothing old is notified. Afterwards every transaction is re-scored against the longer history,
  and the anomaly model is retrained if you use it.
* Old alarms don't flood the alarm summary: alarms on backfilled transactions older than 30 days are
  acknowledged as **legit**, with the comment *Historical (backfill): acknowledged automatically* (you
  would have disputed a fraudulent charge back then). Change the age with `--ack-older-than DAYS`, or
  pass `--keep-alarms` to review them yourself.
* **Backfill came up short?** Run `fraudalert imap-check --since 3y [--folder ...]`. It's read-only and
  lists the server's folders, the oldest message the server shows in the folder, how many emails match your
  sender filter and from when, and any other addresses your bank's domain sent from. The usual causes:
  * **Gmail's IMAP folder size limit** (Settings → See all settings → Forwarding and POP/IMAP → *Folder
    size limits*): when it's on, IMAP only shows a folder's newest messages. Choose *Do not limit*.
  * **Archived mail** is only in All Mail, which is named after your Gmail language (`[Gmail]/All Mail`,
    `[Gmail]/Todos`, ...).
  * **The bank's sender address changed** over the years: add the old address to `FRAUDALERT_SENDER_FILTER`.
* If your bank changed its email layout over the years, older emails may not parse. They're kept on the
  **Emails** page; `fraudalert reevaluate --reparse` retries them after a parser update.

## Spending: trends, budgets and fixed expenses

Since every card transaction already lands here, the **Spending** page turns it into a SCADA-style
*historian* for your budget:

| SCADA | Here |
|---|---|
| Device | **Category** (Groceries, Dining, Transport, ...) |
| Tag | **Merchant** (one tag per business) |
| Tag value | **Spend** in your home currency (other currencies converted) |
| Setpoint | The category's optional **monthly budget** |
| HI / HIHI limit | **80% / 100%** of that budget, month to date |

* **Tag browser:** every category with a moving-bar indicator (fill = month to date against the budget,
  ticks at HI and the setpoint), a **HI**/**HIHI** badge when a limit is reached, and a 6-month
  sparkline. Expand a category to see its merchants with their month-to-date spend and count.
* **Trend:** pick anything in the browser (everything, a category, or one merchant) to trend it by
  **day, week or month** over 30 days, 90 days, a year, or everything on record (months need at least a year). Fixed expenses show as a lighter segment on top of card spending. For a category, the month view draws its HI and HIHI
  limit lines and colours months over a limit. *All spending* has no budget line, because budgets only
  cover some categories (the *Spent this month* tile compares the budgeted categories with their budgets). Every chart has hover tooltips and a table view.
* **Actual vs expected** (setpoint trajectory against process value): the running total for a month
  is plotted against an **expected** curve, which is how your card spending usually builds up through a
  month (the average of the previous 3 complete months, stretched to the month's length) plus that
  month's fixed expenses on their due days. Step back with ‹ › to see how any past month tracked its
  expectation. For the current month, the **forecast** continues from today's actual along the
  expected path. Until there's a complete month on record, it falls back to a straight line from day 7.
* **Expected vs actual, by month:** a bar for what you spent and a tick for what was expected for each
  of the last 6 months (this month shows the forecast too), labelled with the difference in %. Click a
  month to open its running total. Your first partial month of email history is never used as "usual".
* **Categories & tags:** add, rename or delete categories and set or clear their budgets. Merchants are
  categorised automatically from their names the first time they're seen (*auto*). Move a merchant
  from its row, from the trend view, or select several and move them together. What you set is
  marked *you* and never overwritten. Deleting a category moves its merchants to *Uncategorized*.
* **Fixed expenses:** for monthly costs that never reach your card (rent, school fees, transfers,
  cash), add a row on the *Fixed expenses* tab with its amount, currency, category, day of the month and
  the months it applies to (*Until* is optional). Each one is booked on that day every month (the last
  day in shorter months) and shows up as its own tag, marked *fixed*, counting toward its category's
  budget. Nothing is booked in the future, but the month-end projection adds this month's fixed
  expenses at face value and paces only your card spending, so rent on the 1st doesn't inflate it. For
  a price change, set *Until* on the old row and add a new one, so past months keep the old amount.
* In keeping with ISA-101, everything is grey until a budget limit is reached. Transactions you
  acknowledged as **fraud** don't count as spending, and nor do zero-amount card tests.

## Savings: a control loop

Monthly saving is treated as a control problem, the way a process loop would be on a SCADA screen:

| Loop | Here |
|---|---|
| **SP** (setpoint) | your savings target for the month: a fixed amount, or a percentage of the month's income |
| **PV** (process value) | projected savings at month end = income − projected spending |
| **Known disturbances** (feedforward) | recurring **income** and **fixed expenses**, taken off up front: *to spend on cards = income − fixed − target* |
| **Unknown disturbances** (feedback) | card spending, compared every day with a **plan**: fixed expenses on their days plus the card budget spread like your usual month |
| **OUT** (output) | advice, since you're the final control element: **how much you can still spend per day** this month |
| **D** (rate) | last week's card spending against the plan; a warning when spending speeds up, not part of the output |
| **Alarms** | **HI** when projected savings are more than 15% short of the target, **HIHI** when you'd spend more than you earn, with a deadband so they don't chatter |

There's no integral term on purpose: a missed month doesn't raise next month's target.

* Set it up on the **Savings** page: choose the target (fixed or %) and enter your recurring income (amount,
  currency, day of the month, from/until). Fixed expenses come from **Spending → Fixed expenses**.
* **Measurement correction**: alerts miss some purchases. If your latest card statement shows they captured
  less than 98% of what was billed, card spending is scaled up accordingly (at most ×2), the way a plant corrects an
  online analyzer against its last lab sample.
* The **faceplate** shows SP, PV and OUT with the status. The trend shows actual spending against the plan, with
  the forecast and the HI/HIHI limits. The overview's first tile is the projected savings and today's allowance.

## Bank statements: billed vs captured

Your bank's monthly statements (PDF) add the numbers alert emails can't give you: what each card was
actually **billed**, what left each **account**, and the **balances**. Only the totals are kept, never the
statement's line items.

```bash
# .env
FRAUDALERT_STATEMENT_SENDER_FILTER=estadodecuenta@baccredomatic.cr
FRAUDALERT_STATEMENT_SUBJECT_FILTER=        # optional, e.g. "Estado de cuenta"
FRAUDALERT_STATEMENT_PASSWORD=              # if your bank encrypts the PDFs
```

* Every inbox sync (and `fraudalert backfill`) picks up statement emails from that sender and reads their PDF
  attachments. Statements and transaction alerts are searched separately: alert syncs exclude the statement
  sender (`NOT FROM`), so statements never show up as unparsed alerts, even with a broad
  `FRAUDALERT_SENDER_FILTER`. Statements also keep their own sync position: when you turn them on, the first
  sync looks back `FRAUDALERT_LOOKBACK_DAYS` (90 by default), and `fraudalert backfill` goes further.
* Statements arrive once or twice a month, so the inbox is checked for them **once every 24 hours**
  (`FRAUDALERT_STATEMENT_SYNC_HOURS`), not on every alert sync. Expecting one? Press **Check now** on the
  Statements page. Import files by hand on the **Statements** page or with `fraudalert import-statement *.pdf`.
  The same file is never imported twice.
* **Card statements**: for each card and currency, the period's purchases (net of refunds), payments
  received, and the balance at the cut-off. The purchases are compared with what your **alert emails captured** for
  the same card, currency and dates: *coverage* below 95% is flagged **LOW**, meaning some purchases never
  produced an alert (worth checking your bank's alert threshold). The statement says which card each account
  bills, so a card account ending 1111 is matched to the card ending 4321 that your alerts mention.
* **Account statements**: for each account, money out (debits), money in (credits), and the opening and
  closing balance. ✓ means the statement adds up (opening − out + in = closing), which also guards against
  PDF text quirks. The asset and liability totals per currency are tracked too, and **Balances by month**
  shows how they move.
* The overview's **Latest statements** card shows the newest of each.

Supported today: **BAC Credomatic** (Costa Rica), "Estado de cuenta Tarjeta de Crédito" and "Estado de cuenta de
cuenta(s) bancaria(s)". Other banks plug in as a parser in `fraudalert/statements/` (`detect()` recognises the
bank's layout from the PDF text, `parse()` returns the totals) and need no other changes.

## Alarms: fraud monitoring, SCADA style

Industrial control rooms have spent decades learning how to alert a human without drowning them in
noise. This project deliberately borrows that discipline and applies it to card transactions:

* **ISA-18.2 (alarm management)** defines what an alarm is, its lifecycle and its priorities.
* **ISA-101 (HMI design)** defines the "high-performance HMI" look: grey and quiet when things are
  normal, with colour reserved for abnormal conditions, so an alarm stands out the moment it appears.

(ISA-95, often mentioned alongside these, covers integrating business and control systems; it doesn't
define alarm handling, so the alarm behaviour here follows ISA-18.2.)

| ISA-18.2 / SCADA concept | In this dashboard |
|---|---|
| Process event | A card transaction parsed from a bank alert email |
| Alarm | A rule matching a transaction (see **Alarm rules**) |
| Alarm priority | **1 High** (act now), **2 Medium** (check today), **3 Low** (review when convenient); shown by colour, shape *and* number (red square, amber triangle, slate diamond) |
| Unacknowledged alarm | Flashes on the **Alarms** page and counts on the *Alarms* menu item and the overview |
| Acknowledge | **Ack · Legit** / **Ack · Fraud**: your review. The disposition is kept, and doubles as a training label for the anomaly model |
| Latched alarm | Transactions are discrete events, so there is no "return to normal": an alarm stays active until you acknowledge it |
| Alarm summary / journal | **Alarms** page (`/alarms`): *Unacknowledged* (default), *All alarms*, and *Journal* (every transaction) |
| Rationalization | Each rule carries a rationale (why it exists) and a priority. Keep High rare so it keeps its meaning |
| Alarm system KPIs | Alarm rate per day, and priority mix vs. the ISA-18.2 guideline of roughly 5% High / 15% Medium / 80% Low |

Built-in alarms:

* **Card test (zero/near-zero amount)** (High): a `$0.00`-style authorisation. Fraudsters verify a
  stolen card this way right before using it.
* **Charge after a card test** (High): a real charge on the same card within 48 hours of a test-sized one.
* **Large or foreign purchase** (Medium): over 100 in your home currency, made abroad, or in a currency
  you don't normally use.

Existing installs receive new built-in alarms automatically on upgrade (once; if you delete one, it stays deleted).


## Alarm rules

Rules are stored in the database, so you can add, disable or delete them from the **Alarm rules** page or the
API while the pipeline is running. Every change is applied to your whole history straight away.

A rule is a list of conditions joined by **ALL** (AND) or **ANY** (OR), plus a priority. For example:

> **Large or foreign purchase** (Medium): `amount > 100 OR is_foreign = true`
> **Card test** (High): `is_test_amount = true`

| field           | type   | notes                                                      |
|-----------------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `amount`        | number | converted to `FRAUDALERT_HOME_CURRENCY` (approximate rates, see `fraudalert/fx.py`) |
| `amount_original` | number | as charged, in `currency`                                |
| `currency`      | text   | ISO code, e.g. `EUR`                                       |
| `merchant`      | text   | case-insensitive                                           |
| `card_last4`    | text   |                                                            |
| `is_foreign`    | bool   | bought outside `FRAUDALERT_HOME_COUNTRY` (when the email names a country, or says "foreign transaction"), **or** in a currency that isn't one of your normal currencies |
| `unusual_currency` | bool | currency isn't one of your normal currencies (Settings page / `FRAUDALERT_NORMAL_CURRENCIES`) |
| `is_test_amount` | bool  | amount (home currency) ≤ `FRAUDALERT_TEST_AMOUNT_MAX` (default 1.0), e.g. a `$0.00` authorisation |
| `follows_test`  | bool   | the same card had a test-sized transaction within `FRAUDALERT_TEST_FOLLOWUP_HOURS` (default 48) before this one |
| `hour`          | number | 0–23 in `FRAUDALERT_TIMEZONE`                              |
| `weekday`       | number | 0 = Monday                                                 |
| `anomaly_score` | number | 0–1 from the anomaly detector (empty until ~10 transactions of history) |

Operators: `gt gte lt lte eq ne contains not_contains in not_in regex`.

API example:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/rules -H 'content-type: application/json' -d '{
  "name": "Late-night online", "match": "all", "severity": "high",
  "conditions": [{"field": "hour", "op": "lt", "value": 5},
                 {"field": "merchant", "op": "regex", "value": "amazon|paypal|apple"}]}'
```

Other endpoints: `GET /api/transactions?flagged=true`, `GET /api/rules`, `DELETE /api/rules/{id}`, `POST /api/sync`.

## Filtering and bulk edits

The alarm summary's **Filters** panel narrows whichever view you're in (Unacknowledged, All alarms, Journal):
priority, state (unacknowledged / fraud / legit / no alarm), date range (local time), amount (home
currency, the same converted amount rules use), merchant or currency text, card, foreign, alarm rule,
and minimum anomaly score. Filters live in the URL, so back/forward work and a filtered view can be
bookmarked. Each active filter shows as a chip; click its ✕ to drop just that one.

Tick rows (or the header box for the whole page) to act on several at once: **Ack · Legit**, **Ack ·
Fraud**, **Clear ack**, or **Set comment** (empty clears it). When a whole page is selected and more rows
match, **Select all N matching** extends the action to every row the filters match, across pages. Bulk
fraud, and any "all matching" action, asks for confirmation first. Typical use: filter to `netflix`,
select all, **Ack · Legit**.

The same is available over the API:

```bash
curl -X POST localhost:8000/api/transactions/bulk -H 'content-type: application/json' \
     -d '{"ids": [12, 13, 14], "action": "legit"}'        # legit | fraud | clear | comment (+ "comment")
```

## Network map

The **Network** page complements the alarm summary. It draws your cards (squares) and the merchants they were used at (circles, sized by
total spend) as a graph, so unusual patterns stand out at a glance:

* **Colour + glyph = alarm state**, using the same ISA-18.2 priorities as the alarm summary: red **1**,
  amber **2** and slate **3** = an unacknowledged High, Medium or Low alarm; red **✕** with a dark ring =
  acknowledged as fraud; grey **✓** = acknowledged legit; plain grey = normal (ISA-101: normal and handled
  items stay grey). Colour is never the only signal: every state also has a glyph, a label, and a row in
  the table below the map.
* **Dashed ring** = new merchant (first purchase in the last 14 days). **Blue ring** = foreign.
* **Anomaly model on the map:**
  * A **violet halo** shows how unusual a merchant is overall: the share of its transactions that
    score in the top ~15% of your history (≥ 0.85). Everyday merchants stay grey; a merchant that's
    mostly odd transactions glows.
  * A **dotted violet ring** marks merchants with at least one transaction **beyond the anomaly
    limit**. Set the limit with the **Anomaly limit** slider. It starts at your *Unusual pattern*
    alarm threshold (0.97), and the line next to it counts the merchants and transactions beyond it.
  * Tooltips and the merchant table add the score, how many transactions are beyond the limit,
    and **why** the model finds it unusual.
  * The map's positions show who-buys-where, not the model's feature space, so the limit is drawn
    as rings and halos rather than as a line.
* **Hover** a node to see only its connections (which cards used this merchant, or where this card
  was used). **Click** it to pin the details, with a link to its transactions.
* **Highlight anomalies** fades everything normal, leaving flagged, new and foreign merchants.
* Typical things to look for: a card test (a **1** at a new merchant) followed by another **1** on the same
  card, a new foreign merchant hanging off one card, or a merchant only one card has ever used with a large total.

## Daily report email

Once a day at the time you choose (default **20:00** in `FRAUDALERT_TIMEZONE`), the worker emails a
report laid out for calling your bank:

* **Summary:** transactions and spend since the previous report, and new alarms by priority.
* **Needs your attention:** every unacknowledged alarm, each with the local **time**, **amount**,
  merchant, card, and the bank's own **authorization code** (and **reference** when the email has
  one), right under *"Not yours? Call {your bank} at {phone} and quote the authorization code"*.
* **Marked as fraud (last 30 days):** the same details, ready to report.
* **Transactions since the last report:** each with its alarm state.
* **All clear:** a one-line "all clear" when nothing needs attention.

Set it up on **Settings → Daily report**: on/off, time, recipient (defaults to your IMAP address),
bank name and phone, and an optional dashboard link. Use **Send test report now** to check it.
`fraudalert report [--test]` does the same from the command line.

It's sent through Gmail's SMTP with your existing IMAP login and app password, so there's nothing new
to configure. Set `FRAUDALERT_SMTP_*` to use a different mail server or account. The report is sent
once per day. If the machine was off at report time, the next report covers everything since the
last one.

The authorization code and reference (`Autorización` / `Referencia` in BAC alerts; "Authorization
code" / "Reference number" in English ones) are also shown under the merchant on the alarm summary.
Existing installs fill them in automatically on upgrade, by re-reading the stored emails; your
labels and comments are kept.

## Notifications

Set `FRAUDALERT_NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` to get a POST for every new alarm. The message leads with the
priority (`[HIGH] Transaction alarm: ...`). The payload has `text` (Slack/Mattermost), `content` (Discord),
`priority`, and structured `transaction` fields. Transactions older
than 2 days are not sent, so a historical backfill won't flood you.

## Anomaly detection

Every transaction gets an **anomaly score** from 0 to 1 (the *Anom.* column). Rules can use it, and a
built-in **Low**-priority alarm, *Unusual pattern (anomaly model)*, fires at `anomaly_score >= 0.97`.

**Isolation Forest (default, `FRAUDALERT_DETECTOR=iforest`).** An unsupervised model
(scikit-learn) that learns what *your* normal spending looks like, and isolates transactions that
don't fit. The score is a percentile, so **0.97** means more unusual than 97% of your history.

* **Training data:** every stored transaction except those you acknowledged as fraud, using the
  features in `fraudalert/anomaly/features.py` (amount vs. that merchant and vs. all spending, time
  of day, weekday, how often you use the merchant, time since the previous transaction, bursts,
  foreign).
* **When it trains:** needs **50** transactions. Until then scores come from the statistical
  baseline, and the *Anom.* source is recorded per transaction (`anomaly_model`). The worker
  retrains it **nightly** when new transactions have arrived; you can also run
  `fraudalert train` or click **Retrain now** on **Settings**. Training re-scores your whole history.
* **Storage:** the model is stored in Postgres (`anomaly_models`, newest 5 kept), so web and worker
  share it.
* **Sanity check:** **Settings** shows how well it separates what you acknowledged as fraud from
  legit (AUC), next to the baseline, and how many alarms it would raise per 30 days. Legit rows
  are also training data, so this is a sanity check rather than a benchmark.

**Why is it unusual?** For every score of 0.8 or more, the model states up to three reasons in plain
words, e.g. *"5 other transactions in the past 24 hours · minutes after your previous transaction"*
or *"first purchase at this merchant · at 3 am (you usually shop around 7 pm)"*. It does this by
putting each feature group back to your typical value (the training median) and measuring how much
less unusual the transaction becomes. A group is only named when its value really is atypical. The
reasons appear on the alarm summary, the network map, the API (`anomaly_reasons`) and the daily report.

**Baseline (`FRAUDALERT_DETECTOR=baseline`).** A transparent heuristic: an unusual amount for the
merchant, a large amount at a new merchant, foreign, a new merchant, bursts, and 0–5am.

**Next steps.** Your **Ack · Legit / Ack · Fraud** clicks are stored as labels, and `fraudalert
export-features data.csv` exports features + labels. Once there's plenty of history, an autoencoder
(trained on legit transactions) or, with enough confirmed fraud, a supervised classifier can be
added. `fraudalert/anomaly/base.py` shows the small interface a new model implements.

## Parsing emails

`GenericAlertParser` handles the common formats: inline ("You made a $42.10 transaction with
MERCHANT"), labelled fields ("Merchant: …", "Amount: …"), HTML tables, currency symbols and ISO codes
(`$ € £ ¥ …`, `EUR 48,90`, `5,000 JPY`), US and European number formats, and card numbers ("ending in
1234", "****1234"). Statement, payment and login emails are rejected.

`SpanishAlertParser` reads label/value alerts in Spanish (Comercio, Monto, Fecha, Ciudad y país, Tipo de
Transacción), as sent by BAC Credomatic and similar banks. Refunds and reversals are skipped. For a Costa
Rica setup:

```bash
FRAUDALERT_HOME_CURRENCY=USD            # or CRC; colones/dollars are converted either way
FRAUDALERT_NORMAL_CURRENCIES=CRC,USD    # anything else counts as foreign (also on the Settings page)
FRAUDALERT_HOME_COUNTRY=Costa Rica
FRAUDALERT_TIMEZONE=America/Costa_Rica
```

Emails from your bank that couldn't be parsed are listed on the **Emails** page with the reason. If
your bank uses an unusual format, add a `BaseParser` subclass to `fraudalert/ingest/parsers.py`
(ahead of the generic one). A specific parser that recognises an email has the final say: the
generic heuristics only run for emails no specific parser claims.

After updating the app, click **Re-parse all emails** on the Emails page (or run
`fraudalert reevaluate --reparse-all`) to re-read every stored email with the new parsers. Transactions
are updated in place, so your ✓ legit / ✗ fraud labels are kept. **Retry parsing** (`--reparse`) only
retries emails that failed.

## Development

```bash
pytest                                                   # SQLite
FRAUDALERT_TEST_DATABASE_URL=postgresql+psycopg://…/fraudalert_test pytest   # against Postgres
```

Layout: `ingest/` (IMAP, MIME, parsers) · `rules/engine.py` · `anomaly/` (features, detectors) ·
`pipeline.py` (orchestration) · `web/` (FastAPI + Jinja) · `cli.py`.

## Security notes

* The web UI is only reachable from the machine it runs on by default (`127.0.0.1`).
* Changes (POST/DELETE) coming from another website are rejected, so a page you visit can't use
  your saved login to edit rules behind your back.
* Basic auth over plain HTTP is fine on a trusted home network. Don't forward the port to the
  internet; use a VPN such as Tailscale or WireGuard, or put it behind HTTPS.

## Accessing the UI from other computers on your network

Add to `.env`:

```bash
FRAUDALERT_WEB_BIND=0.0.0.0
FRAUDALERT_WEB_USERNAME=you
FRAUDALERT_WEB_PASSWORD=a-long-random-password
```

Then run `docker compose up -d`, and browse to `http://<this-machine's-LAN-IP>:8000` from another
computer. The app refuses to start on the network without a username and password. Outside Docker,
the same applies to `fraudalert serve --host 0.0.0.0`.

If it still doesn't load, the host firewall is usually the cause. Allow inbound TCP 8000: on Windows
use "Allow an app through firewall"; on Linux with ufw run `sudo ufw allow 8000/tcp`; on macOS allow
Docker in System Settings → Network → Firewall.
* Use an app password, never your main email password. `.env` is git-ignored.
* Raw email bodies are stored in the database so they can be re-parsed later. Treat the database as
  sensitive.
